## QHO Expectation Value Calculator

This is a simple python script to calculate the expectation values for arbitrary normalized quantum harmonic oscillator states. The script can calculate 
momentum, magnitude of momentum squared, position and magnitude of position squared expectation values for any normalized ket. There may be updates to improve interface 
and allow square root outputs. 

The recommended use for this code would be to check homework problems where one has to calculate these expectation values. The code can be used to check whether 
written answers are correct or not.
